    <h2>About US</h2>
    <h3><em>Are you tired of never finding games that suit your taste?</em></h3>
    <p>Then <strong>Get Rec'd!</strong> We are a video game recommendation application.
        Simply input the title of a game you've enjoyed, and we'll provide you with some great recommendations! </p>

    <p>
        This application uses content-based filtering powered by a video game dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
        We use TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to find the most relevant games based on descriptions and genres.
    </p>
    <p>
        Account management, recommendations, and image fetching are handled by separate, modular services within our monolithic structure.
