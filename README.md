Are you tired of never finding games that suit your taste?
Then Get Rec'd! 

We are a video game recommendation application. Simply input the title of a game you've enjoyed, and we'll provide you with some great recommendations!

This application uses content-based filtering powered by a video game dataset downloaded from Kaggle. We use TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to find the most relevant games based on descriptions and genres.

Account management, recommendations, and image fetching are handled by separate, modular services within our monolithic structure.
